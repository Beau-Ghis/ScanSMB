[ScanSMB_README 1st.md](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22054819/ScanSMB_README.1st.md)
###### Version 0.0.7 Beta  2025.08.30

The documentation for ScanSMB is written in Markdown format (MD), so the files are saved as .md extensions.  Linux distributions don't typically include MD viewers and open .md files in a  text editor like xed.  This is readable and useful, but using a proper MD viewer is better.  There are many available.  

I happen to be using Obsidian at the moment.  It can be loaded from a package manager (i.e. Synaptic) or from their website https://obsidian.md/download which has many platform choices.  The zip file contains the metadata for Obsidian in .obsidian folders.

Once you've gotten ScanSMB extracted into its folder (i.e. /home/user/ScanSMB), tell Obsidian to create a new vault from an existing folder location and navigate to this folder (at initial load or "Obsidian" link Manage Vaults in lower left).  When it opens you'll have the full set of files to view in the root ScanSMB folder (like this one)  and in ScanSMB/docs which has much more in it.  They will display in the MD enhanced format.
